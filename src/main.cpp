## BEGIN CHANGELOG ##
25.11.21.1  Inverted beam polarity mapping to match 2025 optocoupler outputs
             (LOW=clear, HIGH=broken). Boot-state and detectCar() logic now align
             with field-tested behavior.
25.11.21.0  Renamed all legacy MagSensor identifiers to Beam A / Beam B for 2025 dual-beam hardware.
             Updated all related state variables, timers, and debug messages to match new naming.
             Removed obsolete mag-sensor debug events no longer valid with dual IR beams.
             Verified mapping for normally-HIGH IR optocoupler beams and preserved 2024-proven logic.
             Ensured initial beam states publish correctly on reboot to avoid stale MQTT data.

25.11.20.5  Debugging Inpark Cars
25.11.20.4  Restored the proven 2024 car-detection state machine and added proper
             input-polarity mapping for the new normally-HIGH IR beams via optocoupler.
             Corrected multi-count behavior by adding per-event locking to prevent
             additional counts when Beam B cycles while Beam A remains broken
             (common in heavy, stop-and-go exit traffic). Car detection now triggers
             only once per true Beam-A event and resets only after both beams clear.
             Retains all legacy timing features: 750 ms Beam-A pre-trigger window,
             carDetectMS duration threshold, between-car timing, and TTP reporting.

25.11.20.3  Corrected beam logic inversion in dual-beam detection. Inputs from the
             new optocoupler IR receivers are normally-HIGH, LOW when broken.
             Restored 2024 state-machine semantics (LOW = beam broken) to match
             proven car-counter behavior. Eliminated false state transitions and
             corrected CAR_DETECTED trigger to fire only after B clears. System
             now mirrors the stable 2024 timing and detection reliability.
25.11.20.2  Updated dual-beam integration to use the proven 2024 state machine.
             Re-mapped magSensorPin to Beam A and aligned raw pin reads to the
             state machine’s expected logic (1 = broken, 0 = clear).
             Restored all timing behavior from last season, including
             carDetectMS threshold, 750 ms pre-trigger window, and B-duration
             validation. Removed experimental dual-beam function and corrected
             pinMode configuration for optocoupler inputs.
25.11.20.1  Repurposed magSensorPin as Beam A; implemented dual-beam detection;
            removed inverted magSensor logic and aligned inputs to normally-HIGH beams.
25.11.18.1  Removed SD/RTC infinite while(1) loops to prevent hard lockups;
            Added MQTT firmware publish on connect.
